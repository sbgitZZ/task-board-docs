## What is Task Board?

[**Task Board**](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board) is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to view and manage all your task in a much more efficient Kanban Board format. Easily manage your tasks throughout your vault.

## **How Does it work ?**

- This plugin scans tasks from all or the [filtered](./docs/Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md) Markdown file from your whole vault and show them on a Kanban type Board.
- You can edit the task directly from the Task Board, without opening the Markdown file.
- Add task to currently opened files using a pop-up window.

## Motivation for the Project

I always used the [Kanban Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) to manage my tasks. And it use to work nice for me with all the amazing features. But as soon as I came across the CardBoard Plugin eveything changed. The idea of adding tasks anywhere in your vault and managing them from a single board amazed me. While using kanban plugin the issue was, i wasnt able to add tasks directly to any markdown file, i was required to use the Kanabn Board only to add/edit my tasks, and it use to keep all this tasks in a single markdown file. I immediately switched to the CardBoard plugin after I came across it. But after using it for few days, i realized there are few important features this plugin is lacking and hence I went to first contribute to the main project, but I wasnt familiar with the elm files, hence decided to start my own plugin.

While development I took inspirations from CardBoard and Kanban plugin as well as many feature ideas from [GitHub Project KanBan board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view#about-the-board-layout). I hope I am able to give the best of all this three plugins into one, and will be improving this further.

## Support

A great effort of work has been put into this idea to make it happen. I created the plugin for personal use, but I believed it will surely help other to make their work easier in managing tasks and handling project. If you have got benefitted with this plugin, consider donating for further improvement of this idea.
