**Step 5 :** Once you are done with your changes, click on the `Save` button from the left side bar.

**Step 6 :** You might need to click on the `Refresh Board` button if you changes haven't been reflected automatically.

## Advantages of New Boards

There are various advantages of having multiple types of board instead of just one and using sorting options of individual columns or the whole board again and again to track your tasks properly.

Multiple boards gives you following advantages :

- Helps to segregate your tasks in multiple views.
- Easily switch between different board view, to see only specific tasks.
- Apply filters on the whole board and filter out only related task to the project.
