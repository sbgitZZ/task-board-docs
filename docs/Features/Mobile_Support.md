# Mobile Support

**Added in version 1.4.0**

Task Board now provides comprehensive mobile support, allowing you to manage your tasks on phones and tablets with an optimized user interface and experience.

## Mobile Optimizations

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Responsive Layout**: Task Board automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: All buttons and interactive elements are optimized for touch input
- **Keyboard Management**: The on-screen keyboard is automatically hidden when opening the Add or Edit Task modal (v1.6.11)
- **Auto-hide Progress Bar**: Board progress bar automatically hides on small screens or when the screen is resized (v1.6.11)

### Platform-Specific Features

- **Height Adjustment**: Task Board adjusts its height based on the platform and window dimensions (#239) (v1.6.11)
- **Mobile-Optimized Modals**: All pop-up windows and modals are designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced scrolling performance for task columns on mobile devices

## Mobile Workflow

### Managing Tasks on Mobile

1. **View Tasks**: All your boards and tasks are accessible on mobile devices
2. **Add Tasks**: Use the simplified Add Task modal designed for touch input
3. **Edit Tasks**: Full editing capabilities with mobile-optimized interface
4. **Search Tasks**: Quick search functionality works smoothly on mobile
5. **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns using touch gestures

### Best Practices for Mobile

- Use the search feature to quickly find tasks instead of scrolling through long lists
- Take advantage of auto-hiding elements to maximize screen space
- Configure boards with fewer columns for easier mobile navigation
- Use the board switcher in the header to quickly switch between different boards

## Known Considerations

While Task Board works great on mobile, keep these points in mind:

- Some advanced features may have slightly different interactions on mobile
- Larger screens provide more comfortable editing experience for complex tasks
- Sync your vault across devices to seamlessly transition between desktop and mobile

## Mobile Tips

- **Landscape Mode**: For complex boards, try rotating your device to landscape mode for more horizontal space
- **Column Width**: Mobile view automatically adjusts column widths for optimal viewing
- **Task Cards**: Tap on a task card to view details or edit
- **Gestures**: Use standard touch gestures for scrolling and interacting with tasks
