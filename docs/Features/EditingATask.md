# Editing A Task

There are two ways to edit the old content of your task.

The obvious method is directly editing from the markdown file, explained in detail here : [Edit Task from File](../How_To/HowToEditATask.md#from-the-markdown-file).

But using the [Edit Task Window](../Components/EditTaskWindow.md), you can easily edit the task without opening the parent markdown file.

## How to use the window

This features allows you to directly edit the content of the tasks from the board. You don't have to open the parent markdown file of this task to edit it. The changes will be reflected in the markdown file.

**Enhanced in v1.5.0:** The Edit Task Window now includes a **Live Embedded Editor** for real-time editing with preview.

**Step 1 :** Click on the Edit Icon button to open the **Edit Task Window**. The button is visible when you hover over the task card (v1.1.0).

**Step 2 :** Now Edit any field you want from the specific input field. You can also add values to the empty fields, add description or add more sub-tasks.

**Step 3 :** Remember to press save button after you have made the changes.

**New in v1.3.0:** A confirmation popup will appear if you accidentally try to close the modal without saving your changes.
