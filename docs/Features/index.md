# Task Board Features

Following are some of the key features  of this plugin.

### Task Formats

This plugin will only detect and work with the checkbox items/tasks which are in a specific format. You can use the other formats to make the plugin ignore those tasks or subtasks.

Checkout in Details here : [Task Formats](../Components/Task_Formats.md)

### Adding a Task

There are two way you can add a task to the Task Board. First is the usual old method of directly writing down the task inside the markdown file. The second method is using a **Add New Task** Window to add different properties to the task using input elements to make the adding properties easy and ensuring the format comes properly.
