# Search Tasks

The Search Tasks feature was introduced in version 1.6.0 and allows you to quickly find specific tasks on your board by searching through their content.

## How to Use Search

1. **Access Search**: Look for the search icon in the Task Board header.
2. **Enter Search Query**: Click on the search icon to open the search bar, then type your search query.
3. **View Results**: Tasks matching your search query will be highlighted or filtered on the board.
4. **Focus on Input**: The cursor automatically focuses inside the search input field after clicking the search icon for quick access.

## Search Behavior

- **Content Search**: Currently, the search functionality searches through task content only.
- **Real-time Filtering**: As you type, the board updates to show only tasks that match your search criteria.
- **Clear Search**: Remove your search query to see all tasks again.

> Advanced filters for search (such as searching by tags, dates, or priority) are coming in future releases.

## Tips for Effective Searching

- Use specific keywords from your task titles or descriptions
- Search is case-insensitive for easier matching
- The search works across all columns in the current board

## Auto-hide Progress Bar

In version 1.6.11, an enhancement was added to automatically hide the board progress bar on small screens or when the screen is resized. This provides a cleaner look when using the search feature on mobile devices or smaller displays.
