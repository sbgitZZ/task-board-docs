## How to test beta release

Beta version releases are the versions released for testing and ensuring the plugin will work as expected after the main release. Beta version usually will have the name/tag as minor release version followed by a 'beta' name, followed by a number. Eg.: `1.5.0-beta-2`.

Whenever a new beta version has been released, you will able to get a notification for the same either in the releases tab or in the Announcement section of the discussion.


Follow the below steps to install a beta release for testing : 

### Points to remember before installing

- Use a dummy vault or sandbox vault (for temporary testing). Since new changes might contain some bugs, there is a possibility of data loss. Hence never install a beta version of any plugin inside your main vaults.
- Uninstall any version of previous Task Board you have installed in this current vault. If this if this is your fresh new vault, then no worries.
