## How to test beta release

Beta releases are the versions released for testing and ensuring the plugin will work as expected after the main release. Beta version usually will have the name/tag as minor release version followed by a 'beta' name, followed by a number. Eg.: `1.5.0-beta-2`.

Whenever a new beta version has been released, you will get a notification for the same either through mail if you are watching this repository or in the Announcement section of the discussion.

There are two ways to test a beta version. (First one is easy way) : 

### Download a test vault and start testing

- In every release you will find a zip file attached which you can easily download, unzip and open inside Obsidian.
- For example, here is a test vault attached for the release of the beta version `1.8.0-beta-4` : https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board/releases/tag/1.8.0-beta-4.
- Now, you can start testing the various new features released in this version.
- If you found any issue or bug, see if its again reproducible inside the same test vault, if yes, then zip back this test vault and [create a new issue](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board/issues/new) or email it to sanketgauns8@gmail.com and attach this zip file. And explain what the issue is and how to reproduce it.


### Create your own test vaul

Follow the below steps to install a beta release for testing : 

### Points to remember before installing

- Use a dummy vault or sandbox vault (for temporary testing). Since new changes might contain some bugs, there is a possibility of data loss. Hence never install a beta version of any plugin inside your main vaults.
- Uninstall any version of previous Task Board you have installed in this current vault. If this if this is your fresh new vault, then no worries.
